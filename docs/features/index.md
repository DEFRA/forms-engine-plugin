# Features

forms-engine-plugin provides two categories of features to help you extend and customise your form journeys beyond the out-of-the-box behaviour.

## [Configuration-based Features](./features/configuration-based)

Drive advanced functionality — such as calling APIs and rendering dynamic content — entirely through form definitions, with no custom code required.

## [Code-based Features](./features/code-based)

Implement highly tailored behaviour by writing custom TypeScript/JavaScript that integrates with forms-engine-plugin's extension points.
