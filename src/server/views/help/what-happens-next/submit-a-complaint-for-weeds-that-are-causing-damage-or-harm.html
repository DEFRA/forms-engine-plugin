<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The Defra Forms Service team aim to respond to you within 5 working days.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The Injurious Weeds Complaints Team at Natural England aim to respond to valid complaint forms and emails about ongoing open cases within 10 working days.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If the complaint is valid and the weeds are considered high risk, Natural England will contact the landowner or occupier asking them to remove the weeds by a specific date.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Natural England will contact you to tell you that the landowner or occupier has been notified. We will ask you to get in touch if the landowner or occupier does not clear the weeds by the date specified.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You should do this within 2 weeks of the date specified, otherwise Natural England will assume that you are content with the action taken.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If weeds are considered low risk, Natural England will not usually take action straight away but will ask you to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list">
  <li>continue to monitor the spread of the weeds</li>
  <li>contact an adviser again within 12 months if you think the risk of weeds spreading is increasing</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">Natural England will not usually act on complaints they receive at the end of the growing season, from October to March.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Natural England will contact the landowner or occupier to tell them it has received a complaint.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Landowners or occupiers are usually asked to clear the weeds within 28 days from the date of the letter.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">During June, July, August and September, landowners or occupiers will be asked to clear the weeds within 14 days.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If the landowner or occupier says they have cleared the weeds and you do not object, Natural England will take no action.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">You can inform Natural England if the landowner or occupier has not cleared the weeds. In these cases, Natural England will inspect the land.</p>
